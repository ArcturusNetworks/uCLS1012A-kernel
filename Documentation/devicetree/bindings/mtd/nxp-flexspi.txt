* NXP Flex Serial Peripheral Interface(FlexSPI)

Required properties:
  - compatible : Should be "nxp,lx2160a-fspi"
  - reg : the first contains the register location and length,
          the second contains the memory mapping address and length
  - reg-names: Should contain the reg names "FSPI" and "FSPI-memory"
  - interrupts : Should contain the interrupt for the device
  - clocks : The clocks needed by the FlexSPI controller
  - clock-names : Should contain the name of the clocks: "fspi_en" and "fspi"

Optional properties:
  - nxp,fspi-has-second-chip: The controller has two buses, bus A and bus B.
			      Each bus can be connected with two NOR flashes.
			      Most of the time, each bus only has one NOR flash
			      connected, this is the default case.
			      But if there are two NOR flashes connected to the
			      bus, you should enable this property.
			      (Please check the board's schematic.)
Example:
fspi0: flexspi@20c0000 {
	compatible = "nxp,lx2160a-fspi";
	reg = <0x0 0x20c0000 0x0 0x10000>, <0x0 0x20000000 0x0 0x10000000>;
	reg-names = "FSPI", "FSPI-memory";
	interrupts = <0 25 0x4>; /* Level high type */
	clocks = <&clockgen 4 3>, <&clockgen 4 3>;
	clock-names = "fspi_en", "fspi";

	status = "okay";
	nxp,fspi-has-second-chip;
	flash0: mt35xu512aba@0 {
		reg = <0>;
		....
	};

	flash1: mt35xu512aba@1 {
		reg = <1>;
		....
	};

};
